## 🔌 API Integration

This site integrates with several API endpoints:

### Internal Endpoints

- `/api/send-email` - Handles contact form submissions using nodemailer

### External Endpoints (via Netlify Redirects)

- `/api/website/agent-content` - Fetches content generated by the AI agent from the backend
- `/api/website/request-content` - Sends requests for new content to be generated by the AI agent

The API integration is configured in the `netlify.toml` file, which sets up redirects to the backend server in production:

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "http://5.161.95.205:8000/api/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true
```

## 🚀 Deployment

This site is deployed on Netlify. The deployment configuration is in the `netlify.toml` file.

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables need to be set in Netlify:

- `GMAIL_USER` - Gmail address for the contact form
- `GMAIL_PASS` - Gmail app password for the contact form
- `STRAPI_BLOG_API_URL` - URL for the Strapi CMS API
- `STRAPI_API_KEY` - API key for the Strapi CMS

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## 👨🏻‍💻 Running Locally

You can start using this project locally by running the following command in your desired directory:

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm create astro@latest --template satnaing/astro-paper

# npm
npm create astro@latest -- --template satnaing/astro-paper

# yarn
yarn create astro --template satnaing/astro-paper
```

Then start the project by running the following commands:

```bash
# install dependencies if you haven't done so in the previous step.
pnpm install

# start running the project
pnpm run dev
```

As an alternative approach, if you have Docker installed, you can use Docker to run this project locally. Here's how:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t astropaper .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 4321:80 astropaper
```

## Google Site Verification (optional)

You can easily add your [Google Site Verification HTML tag](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080#meta_tag_verification&zippy=%2Chtml-tag) in AstroPaper using an environment variable. This step is optional. If you don't add the following environment variable, the google-site-verification tag won't appear in the HTML `<head>` section.

```bash
# in your environment variable file (.env)
PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION=your-google-site-verification-value
```
